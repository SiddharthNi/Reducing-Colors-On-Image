# Reducing-Colors-On-Image
"Reducing Colors On Image" I Used  k-Mean Clustering Algorithm.
so the some information about k-Mean Clustering Algorithm is this algorithm is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to solve the clustering problems in machine learning or data science. 

what is k-Mean Clustering Algorithm?

K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm is providing the groups of  the unlabeled dataset into different clusters and "K" defines the no. of pre-defined clusters and that they need to be created in the process.
so, if K=2 is given so there will be two clusters and for K=3 is the given  there will be three clusters

to perform k-Mean Clustering Algorithm steps are the following :-

Step-1: Select the number K to decide the number of clusters.

Step-2: Select random K points or centroids. (It can be other from the input dataset).

Step-3: Assign each data point to their closest centroid, which will form the predefined K clusters.

Step-4: Calculate the variance and place a new centroid of each cluster.

Step-5: Repeat the third steps, which means reassign each datapoint to the new closest centroid of each cluster.

Step-6: If any reassignment occurs, then go to step-4 else go to FINISH.

Step-7: The model is ready.
